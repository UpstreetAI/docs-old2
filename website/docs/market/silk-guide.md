Currently the only way to get SILK is by asking someone you know or the Upstreet Team in the [Upstreet Discord](https://discord.gg/upstreet), sort of like an invite code.

## Origins of SILK

![Silk bots](/img/silkbots.jpg)

In the real world, silk doesn't just appear out of thin air. It takes a lot of work to produce, a process that goes something like:

- Planting mulberry
- Raising silkworms
- Unreeling silk, making thread
- Designing and weaving fabric
- Dying and embroidery

In order to promote the right incentives, there needs to be a system for rewarding the doers and contributors. Alternative ideas for distributing SILK have been mentioned, such as:

- Grants for the [creator program](https://utc9pqk8vl1.typeform.com/to/rZp09YYu)
  - Public project proposals posted on [Github](https://github.com/upstreetai/street-assets/issues)
- Unpacked from Upstreet NFTs
- Airdropped during events and for creating community value
  - [Sourcecred](https://sourcecred.io/) is currently setup on Discord and Github
- Reward for completing bounties
- Trading NFTs for SILK
